# Little-Lemon-homepage
This coursera assessment challenged me to apply your HTML and CSS skills to develop a home page for a fictional client. The requirement was to create a semantic structure with a header, main content, and a footer:

Header: Includes the client's logo and a horizontal navigation menu.

Main Content: Features a large promotional banner and three columns containing text and images.

Footer: Divided into two columnsâ€”one with a smaller logo and the other with copyright information.

I had to make use of either a grid or flexbox layout and utilize CSS selectors and effects to style the page creatively and intentionally. I believe the final project demonstrated effective use of HTML semantics and CSS styling to engage the client's target audience.
